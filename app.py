    st.write("""
    I worked on a fraud detection project where the goal was to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
    The main challenge was handling class imbalance since fraudulent cases were much fewer than normal ones.
    I applied techniques like feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and trained classification models using Scikit-Learn.
    Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were critical in measuring performance.
    Finally, I deployed the model as a Streamlit app for real-time fraud prediction.

    I used Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly to build a responsive dashboard using Superstore sales data.

    I learned how to use interactive filters, KPIs, and charts to tell a clear data story.
